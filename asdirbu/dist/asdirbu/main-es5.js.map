PASLAUGŲ TEIKIMAS</h5>\r\n                    <p>4.1. Tiekėjo įsipareigojimai. Užtikrinate, kad  paslaugas teiksite pagal Bendrąsias sąlygas, Sutartį bei šalies, kurioje teikiate  paslaugas, įstatymus ir teisės aktus. Įsidėmėkite, kad prisiimate visišką atsakomybę už vietos įstatymų ir teisės aktų pažeidimus, įvykdytus teikiant  paslaugas.</p>\r\n                    <p>4.2. Privalote turėti visus  paslaugoms teikti būtinus pažymėjimus, leidimus, licencijas, civilinės atsakomybės draudimą (jei taikoma), registracijos dokumentus, sertifikatus ir kitus dokumentus, reikalaujamus atitinkamoje jurisdikcijoje. Įsipareigojate pasirūpinti visų minėtų dokumentų galiojimu. „Aš dirbu\" pasilieka teisę pareikalauti pavirtinti, kad turite atnaujinimui pateikti visas būtinus pažymėjimus, leidimus, patvirtinimus, įgaliojimus, registracijos dokumentus ir sertifikatus arba pateikti patvirtinimus, kad turite šiuos dokumentus.</p>\r\n                    <p>4.3. Privalote  paslaugas teikti profesionaliai, laikydamiesi šių paslaugų teikimui taikomos verslo etikos, bei stengtis pirkėjo prašymą išpildyti atsižvelgdami į jo interesus. Be kitų dalykų, i) privalote teikti kokybiškas paslaugas; ii) privalote tinkamai reprezentuoti “Aš dirbu” įvaizdį, būti mandagus, tvarkingai apsirengę (tvarkinga darbinė apranga), nesikeikti, elgtis etiškai ir mandagiai; iii) negalite teikti paslaugas su kitais nepažįstamais asmenimis; iv) privalote laikytis galiojančių LR įstaymų ir etiketo normų; v) atvykus pas pirkėją draudžiama bendrauti telefonu, nebent tai būtina norint atlikti paslaugą.</p>\r\n                    <p>4.4. Turite išimtinę teisę nuspręsti, kada norite teikti paslaugas. Pirkėjų prašymus dėl  paslaugų priimate, atmetate arba ignoruojate savo nuožiūra. </p>\r\n                    <p>4.5. Išlaidos, patiriamos teikiant  paslaugas. Privalote savo sąskaita pasirūpinti visa įranga ir priemonėmis, būtinomis  paslaugoms teikti, įskaitant darbo priemones, asmeninės saugos priemones, draudimus, išmanųjį telefoną ir kt., ir jas prižiūrėti. Taip pat esate atsakingas už visas išlaidas, patirtas teikiant  paslaugas, įskaitant, bet neapsiribojant degalais, mobiliųjų duomenų planų mokesčiais, muito mokesčiais, transporto priemonės nusidėvėjimu, draudimu, atitinkamais pelno arba darbo užmokesčio fondo mokesčiais ir t. t. Atkreipkite dėmesį, kad naudodamiesi „Aš dirbu\" programėle išnaudosite didelį kiekį mobiliųjų duomenų, todėl siūlome užsisakyti duomenų planą, leidžiantį duomenimis naudotis neribotai arba suteikiantį labai didelį jų kiekį. </p>\r\n                    <p>4.6. Mokesčiai. Turite teisę prašyti mokesčio kiekvieną kartą patvirtinę „Aš dirbu\" platformoje ir pagal pageidavimą suteikę paslaugą (t. y. mokesčio). Mokestis apskaičiuojamas remiantis jūsų nurodytu baziniu mokesčiu, ir konkrečios paslaugos suteikimo trukme. Numatytasis bazinis mokestis gali kisti priklausomai nuo Jūsų nurodytos sumos. Mokestį su mumis galite derinti atsiųsdami atitinkamą elektroniniu būdu arba ranka pasirašytą prašymą. Be to, visuomet turite teisę imti iš pirkėjo mažesnį mokestį, nei nurodytasis „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje. Tiesa, taikant pirkėjui mažesnį mokestį nei nurodytasis „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje, „Aš dirbu\" mokestis nesumažėja.</p>\r\n                    <p>4.7. Fiksuota paslaugos kaina. Pirkėjui gali būti suteiktas pasirinkimas leidžiantis sutikti su fiksuotu mokesčiu konkrečiai paslaugai, kurios  paslaugos tiekėjas esate jūs (pvz., fiksuota paslaugos kaina). Fiksuota paslaugos kaina pirkėjui nurodoma „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje prieš užsakant paslaugą, o jums priėmus užsakymą arba suteikus paslaugą. Mokestis už paslaugą bus skaičiuojamas kaip nurodyta 4.6. punkte vietoj fiksuotos paslaugos kainos tuomet, pirkėjui paslaugos teikimo metu pakeitus paslaugos teikimo trukmę, dėl neplanuoto didesnio krūvio ar kitų aplinkybių paslaugos teikimui užtrukus ženkliai ilgiau nei apskaičiuota, ar kitoms nenumatytoms aplinkybėms turinčioms reikšmingą įtaką paslaugos suteikimui (pvz. Reikalinga papikdoma įranga norint atlikti darbus).</p>\r\n                    <p>4.8. Jei supratote, kad apskaičiuojant mokestį buvo atlikta klaida ir norite mokesčio skaičiavimą pataisyti, turite pateikti prašymą skiltyje “Atlikta paslauga” „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje. Jei prašymas „Aš dirbu\" programėlės skiltyje „Atlika paslauga\" nepateikiamas, „Aš dirbu\" mokesčio neperskaičiuoja ir neatlygina jums už klaidą, padarytą jį apskaičiuojant. </p>\r\n                    <p>4.9. „Aš dirbu\" gali pakoreguoti mokestį už tam tikrą atliktą užsakymą, mums nustačius pažeidimą (pvz., kad paslaugos teikimas buvo atliktas per ilgesnį nei numatyta laiką)  arba techninę klaidą, dėl kurios pakito galutinė kaina. „Aš dirbu\" taip pat gali sumažinti arba atšaukti mokestį esant pagrįstai priežasčiai manyti, kad buvo sukčiauta arba jeigu remiantis pirkėjo skundu nustatoma, kad įvykdėte pažeidimą. „Aš dirbu\" šią teisę sumažinti ar atšaukti mokestį taiko tik esant pagrįstai priežasčiai. </p>\r\n                    <p>4.10. Pirkėjas mokestį už  paslaugas gali sumokėti per programėlę, kaip nurodyta šių Bendrųjų sąlygų 6 skyriuje. Jei pirkėjas negali ar atsisako sumokėti, „Aš dirbu\" jūsų vardu pirkėjui išduoda pranešimą apie skolą. Ši teisė grindžiama „Aš dirbu\" suteiktu mokėjimų tarpininko įgaliojimu ir nereiškia, kad „Aš dirbu\" yra įpareigoti atlyginti pirkėjo nesumokėtą mokestį. Jei paslaugos pirkėjai nesutinka mokėti už  paslaugos suteikimą, mokestį moka  paslaugą užsakęs pirkėjas. Jei pirkėjas pagrįstai atsisako mokėti, motyvuodamas tuo, kad „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje pateikėte neteisingą informaciją, „Aš dirbu\" jums tokių išlaidų neatlygina. </p>\r\n                    <p>4.11. Kvitai. Kiekvieną kartą sėkmingai atlikus  paslaugas, „Aš dirbu\" suformuoja ir pirkėjui pateikia kvitą, kuriame nurodoma ši informacija: įmonės pavadinimas, veiklos vieta, tiekėjo vardas ir pavardė, tiekėjo nuotrauka, paslaugos licencijos numeris (jei taikoma), paslaugos atlikimo data, laikas, trukmė bei mokestis, sumokėtas už  paslaugų suteikimą. Kvitus už visas suteiktas  paslaugas galite rasti „Aš dirbu\" tiekėjo paskyroje. </p>\r\n                    <p>4.12. Paslaugos atšaukimo mokestis ir laukimo mokestis. Pirkėjas gali atšaukti užsakymą  paslaugai su kuria tiekėjas sutiko per „Aš dirbu\" programėlę. Jei  veiklą teikiančioje rinkoje yra taikomas paslaugos atšaukimo mokestis, tiekėjui jis priklauso tuo atveju, kai pirkėjas atšaukia tiekėjo priimtą užsakymą  paslaugai po tam tikro laiko nustatyto „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje. Taip pat gali būti taikomas laukimo mokestis, pagal sąlygas, kurios nurodytos „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje.</p>\r\n                    <p>4.13. Jei teikiant  paslaugas, pirkėjas ar kiti asmenys tuo metu esantys paslaugos teikimo vietoje, per savo aplaidumą apgadina įrangą, turite teisę pareikalauti pirkėjo sumokėti iki 50 EUR baudą bei padengti baudą viršijančią žalą. Jei pirkėjas nesutinka atlyginti žalos, privalote pranešti mums – mes jūsų vardu išieškosime iš pirkėjo baudą ir (arba) atitinkamas išlaidas. Tiesa, turėkite omenyje, kad mes neprisiimame atsakomybės už tiesioginę ar netiesioginę žalą, susijusią su turto, įrankių ar kitų darbo priemonių techninės priežiūros ar remonto darbais, dėl kurių kaltas pirkėjas. </p>\r\n                    <p>4.14. Jūsų mokestinės prievolės. Sutinkate su tuo, kad įsipareigojate visiškai laikytis visų mokestinių prievolių, kylančių iš taikomų įstatymų, susijusių su  paslaugų teikimu, įskaitant i) pajamų mokesčio, socialinio draudimo mokesčio ir kitų taikomų mokesčių sumokėjimą; ii) visų darbuotojų ir mokesčių registracijos prievolių dėl skaičiavimų, susijusių buhalterine apskaita ir pervedimu į atitinkamas valstybines institucijas pagal galiojančius įstatymus, įvykdymą. Mokesčių inspekcijai mums pateikus pagrįstą prašymą pateikti informaciją apie jūsų veiklą, mes suteiksime mokesčių inspekcijai prieigą prie informacijos apie jūsų veiklą, neviršydami galiojančiuose teisės aktuose numatytų ribų. Be to, jūsų pareiga yra laikytis visų galiojančių mokesčių teisės aktų, taikomų  paslaugų teikimui. Sutinkate atlyginti „Aš dirbu\" visus valstybinius mokesčius, reikalavimų sumas, mokėjimus, baudas ir kitas mokestines prievoles, patirtas „Aš dirbu\" dėl jūsų neįvykdytų taikomuose mokesčių teisės aktuose numatytų prievolių (įskaitant pajamų mokesčio ir socialinio draudimo mokesčio sumokėjimą). </p>\r\n                    <p>4.15. Tiekėjo teisė išduoti sąskaita faktūras. „Aš dirbu\" turi teisę jūsų vardu išrašyti pirkėjui sąskaitą faktūrą, siekiant atlyginti jums bet kokius mokesčius, sutartines baudas ar kitus mokesčius, kuriuos jums perveda „Aš dirbu\". Sąskaitą faktūrą rasite „Aš dirbu\" tiekėjo paskyroje. \r\n                                        \r\n                    <h5 class=\"text-primary font-weight-bold\">5. „Aš dirbu\" MOKESČIAI</h5>\r\n                    <p>5.1. Norėdami naudotis „Aš dirbu\" paslaugomis, privalote sumokėti mokestį (t. y. „Aš dirbu\" mokestį). „Aš dirbu\" mokestis mokamas remiantis kiekvieno jūsų atlikto  paslaugos užsakymo mokesčiu. „Aš dirbu\" mokesčio suma jums pranešama el. paštu, „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje, „Aš dirbu\" tiekėjo paskyroje arba kitomis atitinkamomis priemonėmis. Turėkite omenyje, kad „Aš dirbu\" mokestis kartais gali keistis. Mes prieš kiekvieną tokį pasikeitimą jums atsiųsime išankstinį pranešimą. </p>\r\n                    <p>5.2. „Aš dirbu\" mokestį ar kitus mokesčius, kuriuos privalote sumokėti mums už praėjusį mėnesį, turite sumokėti ne vėliau kaip iki kito mėnesio -7- tos dienos. Pavėlavus sumokėti „Aš dirbu\" mokestį, privalote sumokėti delspinigius, kurių dydis lygus 0,04 % (keturioms šimtosioms procento) nesumokėtos sumos už kiekvieną dieną. Privalote padengti visas mūsų patirtas išlaidas, susijusias su skolų išieškojimu.</p> \r\n                    \r\n                    <h5 class=\"text-primary font-weight-bold\">6. PER PROGRAMĖLĘ ATLIEKAMI MOKĖJIMAI</h5>\r\n                    <p>6.1. Mes galime suteikti pirkėjams galimybę sumokėti už  paslaugą tiesiogiai per „Aš dirbu\" programėlę (per programėlę atliekamas mokėjimas) kortele, atsiskaitant el. bankininkystės ar kitais mokėjimo būdais. Leidžiate mums veikti kaip jūsų ribotų įgaliojimų prekybos agentas išimtinai siekiant jūsų vardu surinkti pirkėjo per programėlę sumokėtus mokesčius bei kitus mokesčius. Bet kokia per programėlę atlikta mokėjimo prievolė laikoma įvykdyta mokėjimo atlikimo momentu. </p>\r\n                    <p>6.2. Neturite teisės atmesti pirkėjo per programėlę atlikto mokėjimo arba bandyti atkalbėti pirkėjo nuo mokėjimo per programėlę. Jums be pagrįstos priežasties atsisakius priimti per programėlę atliktą mokėjimą, mes turime teisę pritaikyti jums 15 eurų dydžio sutartinę baudą už kiekvieną atsisakymo atvejį ir (arba), elgesiui kartojantis, užblokuoti jūsų teisę naudotis „Aš dirbu\" paslaugomis. </p>\r\n                    <p> 6.3. „Aš dirbu\" pasilieka teisę savo nuožiūra platinti nuolaidos kodus savo klientams reklaminiais tikslais. Jūs sutinkate su nuolaidos kodo panaudojimo tvarka nepriklausomai ar paslauga apmokama per programėlę ar grynaisiais. Įtarus, kad nuolaidos kodų naudojimas yra apgaulingas, neteisėtas, tiekėjo naudojamas nesilaikant nuolaidos kodų naudojimo taisyklių ir sąlygų, nuolaidos kodas gali būti panaikintas, o neapmokėto skirtumo „Aš dirbu\" tiekėjui nekompensuoja.</p>\r\n                    <p>6.4. Turite teisę peržiūrėti per programėlę atliktų mokėjimų ataskaitas „Aš dirbu\" tiekėjo paskyroje arba programėlėje. Ataskaitoje nurodomos per programėlę atliktų mokėjimų sumos, pervestos praėjusią savaitę, bei atskaitytos „Aš dirbu\" mokesčio sumos. Privalote mus informuoti apie svarbias aplinkybes, kurios galėtų turėti įtakos mūsų įsipareigojimų surinkti ir paskirstyti per programėlę sumokėtus mokesčius vykdymui. </p>\r\n                    <p>6.5. Mes nesame įsipareigoję išmokėti jums mokesčio, kurį jums skolingas pirkėjas, tuo atveju, jei per programėlę atliktas mokėjimas nebuvo įskaitytas dėl netinkamos pirkėjo kreditinės kortelės arba kitokio pobūdžio mokėjimas atšaukiamas ar neįskaitomas dėl kitų priežasčių. Tokiu atveju padėsime jums išreikalauti iš pirkėjo nesumokėto mokesčio ir perversime jį jums, kai tik pirkėjas atliks prašomą mokėjimą. </p>\r\n                    <p>6.6. Prieš teikdami  paslaugas, privalote įsitikinti, kad paslauga iš tiesų teikiama atitinkamam pirkėjui arba, kad pirkėjas tiesiogiai patvirtino, jog leidžia kitiems pirkėjams pirkti paslaugas naudojantis pirkėjo paskyra. Jei per klaidą identifikavote ne tą pirkėją, o per programėlę atliekamas mokėjimas priskiriamas asmeniui, kuriam nebuvo suteiktos  paslaugos arba kuris neužsakė šių paslaugų kitiems pirkėjams, tuomet mes atlyginame šiam asmeniui mokestį. Tokiu atveju jūs neturite teisės atgauti mokesčio iš mūsų. Be to, už kiekvieną netinkamai priskirtą per programėlę atliktą mokėjimą mes turim teisę pritaikyti jums sutartinę baudą iki 10 eurų. </p>\r\n                    <p>6.7. Atkreipkite dėmesį, kad mes visus mokesčius, sumokėtus per programėlę atliktais mokėjimais, atskaitysime iš sumų, kurias esate mums skolingi (pvz., „Aš dirbu\" mokesčių ir sutartinių baudų). Mes pasiliekame teisę įvykdyti bet kuriuos iš jūsų finansinių įsipareigojimų bet kurioms UAB „PILKA LINIJA\" grupės įmonėms – tokiu atveju mes įgyjame teisę pateikti jums mokėjimo reikalavimą. Mes galime bet kokius jūsų finansinius įsipareigojimus atskaityti iš finansinių įsipareigojimų, kuriuos esate iškėlę mums. </p>\r\n                    <p>6.8. Jei mes negalime sumokėti jums mokesčių dėl to, kad nepateikėte savo banko sąskaitos duomenų savo tiekėjo paskyroje arba jei banko sąskaitos duomenys nurodyti neteisingai, tuomet mes tokius mokėjimus laikome 180 dienų. Jei per 180 dienų nuo dienos, kai įgyjama teisė reikalauti šių mokėjimų, nepateikiate mums teisingų banko sąskaitos duomenų, jūsų reikalavimo dėl jums nepervesto mokesčio sumokėjimo terminas laikomas pasibaigusiu.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                    <h5 class=\"text-primary font-weight-bold\">7.

REITINGAS IR AKTYVUMAS</h5>\r\n                    <p>8.1. Sutinkate su tuo, kad, siekiant užtikrinti aukštos kokybės aptarnavimą ir papildomai paskatinti pirkėjus, pirkėjai galės jums paskirti įvertinimą ir palikti atsiliepimą apie jūsų suteiktų  paslaugų kokybę. Jūsų bendras reitingas bus susietas su jūsų tiekėjo paskyra, o pirkėjai jį galės matyti „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje. Sužinoję, kad įvertinimas ar komentaras buvo palikti nesąžiningai, galime šio įvertinimo ar komentaro neįskaičiuoti į jūsų reitingą. </p>\r\n                    <p>8.2. Be reitingo taip pat matuojame jūsų aktyvumo lygį ir skiriame jums aktyvumo balą, kuris yra paremtas tuo, kiek  paslaugų prašymų priimate, atmetate, ignoruojate ir įvykdote. </p>\r\n                    <p>8.3. Siekiant teikti patikimas paslaugas pirkėjams, mes galime nustatyti mažiausią vidutinį reitingą ir mažiausią aktyvumo balą, kurį tiekėjai privalo pasiekti ir išlaikyti.

Atkreipkite dėmesį, kad naudodamiesi „Aš dirbu\" programėle išnaudosite didelį kiekį mobiliųjų duomenų, todėl siūlome užsisakyti duomenų planą, leidžiantį duomenimis naudotis neribotai arba suteikiantį labai didelį jų kiekį.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.6. Mokesčiai. Turite teisę prašyti mokesčio kiekvieną kartą patvirtinę „Aš dirbu\" platformoje ir pagal pageidavimą suteikę paslaugą<br> (t. y. mokesčio). Mokestis apskaičiuojamas remiantis jūsų nurodytu baziniu mokesčiu, ir konkrečios paslaugos suteikimo trukme. Numatytasis bazinis mokestis gali kisti priklausomai nuo Jūsų nurodytos sumos. Mokestį su mumis galite derinti atsiųsdami atitinkamą elektroniniu būdu arba ranka pasirašytą prašymą. Be to, visuomet turite teisę imti iš pirkėjo mažesnį mokestį, nei nurodytasis „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje. Tiesa, taikant pirkėjui mažesnį mokestį nei nurodytasis „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje, „Aš dirbu\" mokestis nesumažėja.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.7. Fiksuota paslaugos kaina. Pirkėjui gali būti suteiktas pasirinkimas leidžiantis sutikti su fiksuotu mokesčiu konkrečiai paslaugai, kurios  paslaugos tiekėjas esate jūs (pvz., fiksuota paslaugos kaina). Fiksuota paslaugos kaina pirkėjui nurodoma „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje prieš užsakant paslaugą, o jums priėmus užsakymą arba suteikus paslaugą. Mokestis už paslaugą bus skaičiuojamas kaip nurodyta 4.6. punkte vietoj fiksuotos paslaugos kainos tuomet, pirkėjui paslaugos teikimo metu pakeitus paslaugos teikimo trukmę, dėl neplanuoto didesnio krūvio ar kitų aplinkybių paslaugos teikimui užtrukus ženkliai ilgiau nei apskaičiuota, ar kitoms nenumatytoms aplinkybėms turinčioms reikšmingą įtaką paslaugos suteikimui (pvz. Reikalinga papikdoma įranga norint atlikti darbus).\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.8. Jei supratote, kad apskaičiuojant mokestį buvo atlikta klaida ir norite mokesčio skaičiavimą pataisyti, turite pateikti prašymą skiltyje “Atlikta paslauga” „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje. Jei prašymas „Aš dirbu\" programėlės skiltyje „Atlika paslauga\" nepateikiamas, „Aš dirbu\" mokesčio neperskaičiuoja ir neatlygina jums už klaidą, padarytą jį apskaičiuojant.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.9. „Aš dirbu\" gali pakoreguoti mokestį už tam tikrą atliktą užsakymą, mums nustačius pažeidimą (pvz., kad paslaugos teikimas buvo atliktas per ilgesnį nei numatyta laiką)  arba techninę klaidą, dėl kurios pakito galutinė kaina. „Aš dirbu\" taip pat gali sumažinti arba atšaukti mokestį esant pagrįstai priežasčiai manyti, kad buvo sukčiauta arba jeigu remiantis pirkėjo skundu nustatoma, kad įvykdėte pažeidimą. „Aš dirbu\" šią teisę sumažinti ar atšaukti mokestį taiko tik esant pagrįstai priežasčiai.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.10. Pirkėjas mokestį už  paslaugas gali sumokėti per programėlę, kaip nurodyta šių Bendrųjų sąlygų 6 skyriuje. Jei pirkėjas negali ar atsisako sumokėti, „Aš dirbu\" jūsų vardu pirkėjui išduoda pranešimą apie skolą. Ši teisė grindžiama „Aš dirbu\" suteiktu mokėjimų tarpininko įgaliojimu ir nereiškia, kad „Aš dirbu\" yra įpareigoti atlyginti pirkėjo nesumokėtą mokestį. Jei paslaugos pirkėjai nesutinka mokėti už  paslaugos suteikimą, mokestį moka  paslaugą užsakęs pirkėjas. Jei pirkėjas pagrįstai atsisako mokėti, motyvuodamas tuo, kad „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje pateikėte neteisingą informaciją, „Aš dirbu\" jums tokių išlaidų neatlygina.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.11. Kvitai. Kiekvieną kartą sėkmingai atlikus  paslaugas, „Aš dirbu\" suformuoja ir pirkėjui pateikia kvitą, kuriame nurodoma ši informacija: įmonės pavadinimas, veiklos vieta, tiekėjo vardas ir pavardė, tiekėjo nuotrauka, paslaugos licencijos numeris (jei taikoma), paslaugos atlikimo data, laikas, trukmė bei mokestis, sumokėtas už  paslaugų suteikimą. Kvitus už visas suteiktas  paslaugas galite rasti „Aš dirbu\" tiekėjo paskyroje.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.12. Paslaugos atšaukimo mokestis ir laukimo mokestis. Pirkėjas gali atšaukti užsakymą  paslaugai su kuria tiekėjas sutiko per „Aš dirbu\" programėlę. Jei  veiklą teikiančioje rinkoje yra taikomas paslaugos atšaukimo mokestis, tiekėjui jis priklauso tuo atveju, kai pirkėjas atšaukia tiekėjo priimtą užsakymą  paslaugai po tam tikro laiko nustatyto „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje. Taip pat gali būti taikomas laukimo mokestis, pagal sąlygas, kurios nurodytos „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.13. Jei teikiant  paslaugas, pirkėjas ar kiti asmenys tuo metu esantys paslaugos teikimo vietoje, per savo aplaidumą apgadina įrangą, turite teisę pareikalauti pirkėjo sumokėti iki 50 EUR baudą bei padengti baudą viršijančią žalą. Jei pirkėjas nesutinka atlyginti žalos, privalote pranešti mums – mes jūsų vardu išieškosime iš pirkėjo baudą ir (arba) atitinkamas išlaidas. Tiesa, turėkite omenyje, kad mes neprisiimame atsakomybės už tiesioginę ar netiesioginę žalą, susijusią su turto, įrankių ar kitų darbo priemonių techninės priežiūros ar remonto darbais, dėl kurių kaltas pirkėjas.\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.14. Jūsų mokestinės prievolės. Sutinkate su tuo, kad įsipareigojate visiškai laikytis visų mokestinių prievolių, kylančių iš taikomų įstatymų, susijusių su  paslaugų teikimu, įskaitant i) pajamų mokesčio, socialinio draudimo mokesčio ir kitų taikomų mokesčių sumokėjimą; ii) visų darbuotojų ir mokesčių registracijos prievolių dėl skaičiavimų, susijusių buhalterine apskaita ir pervedimu į atitinkamas valstybines institucijas pagal galiojančius įstatymus, įvykdymą.

Be to, jūsų pareiga yra laikytis visų galiojančių mokesčių teisės aktų, taikomų  paslaugų teikimui. Sutinkate atlyginti „Aš dirbu\" visus valstybinius mokesčius, reikalavimų sumas, mokėjimus, baudas ir kitas mokestines prievoles, patirtas „Aš dirbu\" dėl jūsų neįvykdytų taikomuose mokesčių teisės aktuose numatytų prievolių (įskaitant pajamų mokesčio ir socialinio draudimo mokesčio sumokėjimą).\r\n                            </p>\r\n                            <p>\r\n                                4.15.

Norėdami naudotis „Aš dirbu\" paslaugomis, privalote sumokėti mokestį (t. y. „Aš dirbu\" mokestį). „Aš dirbu\" mokestis mokamas remiantis kiekvieno jūsų atlikto  paslaugos užsakymo mokesčiu. „Aš dirbu\" mokesčio suma jums pranešama el. paštu, „Aš dirbu\" programėlėje, „Aš dirbu\" tiekėjo paskyroje arba kitomis atitinkamomis priemonėmis. Turėkite omenyje, kad „Aš dirbu\" mokestis kartais gali keistis.

Leidžiate mums veikti kaip jūsų ribotų įgaliojimų prekybos agentas išimtinai siekiant jūsų vardu surinkti pirkėjo per programėlę sumokėtus mokesčius bei kitus mokesčius.
